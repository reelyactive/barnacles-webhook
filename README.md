barnacles-webhook
=================

Webhook interface for [barnacles](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnacles/) open source software.  A webhook provides event notifications via HTTP POST.  We believe in an open Internet of Things.


Installation
------------

    npm install barnacles-webhook


Hello barnacles-webhook
-----------------------

The following code will POST _simulated_ [raddec](https://github.com/reelyactive/raddec/) data to the /raddecs route on a local server running on port 80.  The simulated data is provided by [barnowl](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnowl/) which is typically run in conjunction with [barnacles](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnacles/).  Install the _barnowl_, _barnacles_ and _barnacles-webhook_ packages using npm before running the code.

```javascript
const Barnowl = require('barnowl');
const Barnacles = require('barnacles');
const BarnaclesWebhook = require('barnacles-webhook');

let barnowl = new Barnowl();
barnowl.addListener(Barnowl, {}, Barnowl.TestListener, {});

let barnacles = new Barnacles({ barnowl: barnowl });
barnacles.addInterface(BarnaclesWebhook, { /* See options below */ });
```
